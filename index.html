        <h2 name="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        <p>My goal is to bridge the gap between business and developers. With soft skills, a background in marketing, and the ability to code, I want to help reduce some of the friction that can happen when business people and developers collaborate.</p>
        <p>I started out in marketing and got my BBA in it. I’ve worked at a marketing agency, an e-comm business, and done some freelancing too. While I really enjoyed the customer service, strategy, and design sides of marketing, I found myself wanting more. I love learning and pushing myself, and during a website redesign project, I found my next step: web development. Knowing how I work, I decided to dive in and learn web dev on my own—with the help of freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and lots of Googling, of course. I’ve developed and honed my skills through projects like [highlight projects/work you’ve done]. Now I’m putting those skills into action and I can’t wait to tackle more and see what the future has in store for me.  
            Warmest regards, HT</p>
